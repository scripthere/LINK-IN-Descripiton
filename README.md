hello guys 
the lucky one deletes the script
but I came back with the script
link for download script:https://mega.nz/file/ogNyxDYZ#byTT_GhyWs6jiGeQH7D-cY7prrHfuZpYDGNL1XuTG7E
end
    I talked to lucky he said that now I can publish this test script
    enjoy with the script
     
        
        if the script doesn't run on your executor use these executors:
        Coco Z
        https://wearedevs.net/d/Coco%20Z
        
        Krnl
        https://wearedevs.net/d/Krnl
        or
        https://krnl.ca/
       
       Synapse X
       ----------------
       you need to pay
       ----------------
       https://x.synapse.to/
       
       -
       no execute
       --
       if you run the script and a message appears saying that the script is being modified and is under construction
       -
       and the script is under construction
